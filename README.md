Reflection
The QR Code Component project from Frontend Mentor was a valuable exercise in front-end design and development. The task was to create a clean, responsive QR code component using HTML and CSS, focusing on simplicity and effective communication.

Key Highlights
Responsive Design: Ensured the component adapts well to different screen sizes with a centered layout and flexible dimensions.
Visual Appeal: Employed a minimalist design with a soft background, rounded corners, and subtle box-shadow to enhance aesthetics.
Typography and Styling: Used the Poppins font for a modern look, with careful attention to text color and size for readability.
Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced skills in responsive design, CSS styling, and user experience, emphasizing the importance of clear, accessible design. It was a great step forward in refining my front-end development skills.
